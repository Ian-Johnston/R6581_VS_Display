1 -  17, 15, 1, 50, 30, 10         Haven't tested fully
2 -  17, 15, 2, 50, 30, 10         Stable with freezer spray & heat gun, single vertical line at right
3 -  17, 15, 3, 50, 30, 10         Flickers when cold, no vertical line
4 -  17, 15, 4, 50, 30, 10         Flickers badly

7 -  17, 14, 3, 50, 30, 10         Stable with freezer and heat gun, has a single vertical line
8 -  17, 14, 4, 50, 30, 10         Stable (except once on startup) with freezer and heat gun, no vertical line - ORIGINAL
Option 6 seems to be the closest to the AdaFruit example but has a vertical line down the right hand side which I can't get rid of. It's the most stable.
Well, I can by adjusting other parameters but it makes the TFT unstable (flickers).
So, I have elected to go with option 6 and have put a thin strip of 1mm black tape down the right side over the pixels!
Wierdly, my other R6581T, and ADCMT unit, has no flicker or pixel issues at all.
